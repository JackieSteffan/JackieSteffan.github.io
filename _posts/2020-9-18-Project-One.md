# Hockey Project  
  
In my project I made functions to connect to 8 hockey related APIs. I then made a wrapper function and did some analytics on the data.  
  
What would you do differently?  
I probably would have started a little earlier. APIs are incredibly daunting to me. It was the homework I struggled with the most. I have found them to be not at all user friendly with strange formatting that makes them incredibly difficult to deal with.  
  
What was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?  
As I mentioned above, definitely the formatting of the APIs. There were lists embedded in lists with dataframes embedded in others. It was not standard page to page and incredibly hard to figure out how to drill into a dataframe embedded in another dataframe.  
  
What is your big takeaway for future projects?  
I think to not be afraid to ask questions. I sometimes felt like I was the only person struggling with this project because no one else was asking questions on the discussion board. I worried that my peers would think I was dumb for posting so many issues, but in reality, if I was struggling with something, someone else probably was too.
