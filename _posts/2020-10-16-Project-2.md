In this project I looked at an online news popularity data set. I looked at some summary statistics and looked for relationships with my predictor variable `shares`. I then created 2 models, a regression tree and a boosted tree to predict the number of shares for an article (using a test and training dataset). Lastly, I automated this and produced the same report based on what day each article was posted.  

## What would you do differently?  
When I first started on this project, I spent a lot of time waiting on my code to run, only after a couple days did I change to just running a subset of my data to ensure that my code would work.  
  
## What was the most difficult part for you?  
I really struggled with the automation section, for some reason by brain couldn't work through having the automation in a different script and somehow being able to talk to my rmd file. Once I successflly ran it it made sense though.  
  
## What are your big take-aways from this project?
My big takeaways are how simple it is to make a report that is the same across a parameter. A lot of times at work I get frustrated having to do the same work over again for similar information, but now I know I can automate it.
