# Thoughts on R

## What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
There are definitely pros and cons to R, I like that you can do simple calculations in a single line, like matlab, but when it comes to statistically programming SAS makes a little more sense to me.  
  
## What functionality do you like about R?  
I like that you are able to do quick math in R and that there is a ton of data preloaded with the base package and other packages that are pretty easy to load in  
  
## What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Most of my experience has been in SAS or more point and click software, like Tableau. I miss the structure of SAS. When you work in SAS you can tell what each section is there for and have a general idea of what the output will look like.
  
## Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)  
I had done a little bit of work in R in previous classes and when I first started working in R I was completely lost. I basically copied and pasted code from lectures and used google to figure out how to make the chages I wanted.  
I do think R is difficult to learn on your own, but when someone is teaching you it makes a little more sense. The help section is sometimes helpful, but most of the time I would get lost in the semantics and verbiage.
