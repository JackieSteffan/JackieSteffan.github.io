## What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do.  
  
I think I had a fairly good idea of what data scientists did, but I learned a lot about the methods they use. In statistics coursework, when you learn about modeling, you really just learn about regression based models. I found it helpful to learn about some of the other supervised and unsupervised learning methods that I hadn't heard about in my other coursework.  
    
## What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - Do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
  
I have really learned to appreciate R and it's capabilities through this course. In my first R post I talked a lot about how much I liked the structure of SAS, but after using and really learning R I have come to appreciate being able to write a single line of code and get the same output as a long proc statement.  I think I will continue to use R going forward, especially since the graphics are so much better than other statistical software I've used. I also think the $0 price tag is a good sell for convincing management that R is a good tool to use.  
  
## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
  
One of the thing's I think has been beneficial to me was learning R Markdown, I have seen other people use it but didn't really understand how it worked.  I have started using R Markdown for some of my other classes that require typed homework and I think I will continue doing that in my other classes.
