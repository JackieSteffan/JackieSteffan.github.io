title: First Blog Post: Data Scientists

What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

The articles lead me to think that a data scientist is really a middleman between the subject matter experts and the IT folks. 
They are able to understand the problems that the subject matter experts are facing and find a solution using some sort of statistical knowledge blended with coding knowledge and then translate it into verbiage that the coding or IT people would understand and be able to implement company wide.


What do you see as their major duties and/or knowledge areas?

As previously mentioned, data scientists help find solutions to business needs using data analysis. This includes exploratory analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. They generally have a good understanding of statistics, programming, and the business needs.

 
 What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
 
 Data scientists and statisticians both have to have a good knowledge of statistics. While statisticians do use software to make a lot of their calculations, it seems that data scientists have to have a little more understanding of the programming languages.
 Data scientists also seem to use larger data sets and follow a slightly different process for conducting analysis (the "data science process" as opposed to statistical processes). With these processes come different terms for essentially the same thing.
 At the end of the day, it seems like data scientists start with statistics and then add some more to it.
 
 
 How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
 
 For me there is a decent amount of crossover in the two areas. I think it comes down the the industry you are working in. It's hard for me to visualize a statistician in a business industry and it's hard to visualize a data scientist in an academic or research industry. I like working in more of a business atmosphere, I currently work in healthcare. I have often described the need for a middleman between content experts and the people in IT who don't seem to have much subject matter knowledge outside of their databases and coding knowledge. Reading these articles has given me some clarity that the need I've often described to coworkers and leadership is really a data scientist.
