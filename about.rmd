# **Hi There!**

My name is Jackie Steffan and I am currently enrolled in the Statistics Masters program at NC State.

### In the unlikely event you want to know more about me, here are some fun facts!

I grew up in Maryland, moved to Raleigh for about 5 years and now live in Johnson City, TN (living my best Wagon Wheel life)
  
I also went to NC State for undergrad where I majored in Math and Statistics. 
I **LOVE** my Wolfpack and try to get back to Raleigh for at least one football game and one basketball game every season
  
My husband's name is Andy, he's a chemical engineer. We met at State and have been married for 3 years, he's the best!!
  
I have a black and white cat named Oliver and a black lab mix named Scout. Scout loves Oliver and Oliver ~~likes~~ tolerates Scout.  I'm pretty sure Oliver really does like Scout, he just doesn't want us to know.
  
I never found a quarantine hobby, I ~~tried~~ failed at making macarons, ran out of house projects, and could never quite get in tune with my crafty side.  However, I did use my extra time to take a chunk out of my long neglected reading list. I've read 21 books since April, which I'm pretty sure is more than I've read in the last 8 years combined.
